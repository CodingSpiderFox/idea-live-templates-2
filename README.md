# IDEA Live Templates

A collection of useful live templates that you can use within your PhpStorm or IntelliJ IDEA installation.

The structure of this repository as well as the handy script to list all templates has been heavily inspired
by https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/idea-live-templates. Kudos go to the repository maintainer.

# Installation

- Find the [has you covered](location where live templates are stored) for your IntelliJ IDE version.
- `cd` into that location, run `git clone https://github.com/gridonic/idea-live-templates.git gridonic` and restart your IDE.
- Profit!
